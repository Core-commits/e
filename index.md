#### What are levels of organization?

**Levels of organization** or **organisation of living matter** is the method sued to classify living organisms based on their chemical components and structures.

## Connective Tissues:
All the type of connective tissues.
 ### Connective Tissue:
 
 - It's located on the deepest layer of our skin.
 
- constitues "stuffing" between organs.
- extracellular matrix contains many fibres.

###  Adipose tissue:
	
- It is found all over the **body**

- their main function is to store energy and other functions

- their extracellular matrix is nonexistant

### Cartilaginous Tissue
- Found on bones

- It's function is to strengenth the larynx the trachea and form structures such as the pinna or the nose.

### Bone tissue
- Found all over the organism

- It supports the organism
- A great ammount of minerals is it's matrix.

 ### Muscle tissue:

- **There are two types**
	- Smooth muscle tissue
		- responsible of the movement of organs (stomach, or uterus)
	- Striated muscle tissue
		- Contracts voluntarily
	
	(Extra! There's also Cardiac Muscle tissue is a special type of tissue because it has fibres but moves unvolutarily)

### Nervous Tissue

Nervous tissue is composed of very specialised cells called neurons, which transmite nerve impulses.
